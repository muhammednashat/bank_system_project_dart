_ Deposit Money → Add funds asynchronously.
_ Withdraw Money → Secure withdrawal with balance check.
_ Transaction History → Track every operation.
_ Transfer Money → Safely move funds between accounts.
_ Branch Simulation (Isolates) → Multiple branches run in parallel.
_ Async Delays → Mimic real-world slow network/banking operations.
